# ugrep: find unicode characters based on their names or number.
# 	 Essentially grep for the Unicode table.

# PREREQUISITES: You must have a copy of UnicodeData.txt installed.
# On Debian GNU/Linux, this can be done by `apt install unicode-data`.
# Or, you can download it by hand from the Unicode Consortium and
# place it in `~/.local/share/unicode/UnicodeData.txt`.

# Fun things to try:

# ugrep alchemical 
# ugrep ornament
# ugrep bullet
# ugrep 'vine|bud'
# ugrep vai
# ugrep heavy
# ugrep drawing
# ugrep 2300..ff

ugrep: find unicode characters based on their names or codepoints
Usage: 
    ugrep [-w] <character> | <codepoint ...> | <character name>
    ugrep -c <character string>

    	-w:	matches only whole words, e.g., ugrep -w pi
    	-c:	matches each character in the string, e.g., ugrep -c "(ﾟ∀ﾟ)"

    <character> is a single character, e.g.:  ugrep ☙
    <codepoint> is one or more hexadecimal unicode character numbers, 
		optionally prefixed by "U+" or "0x".e.g.: ugrep U+1F639.
    		Ranges are allowed with two dots: ugrep 23b0..f
    <character name> is a regular expression, see examples below.
    <character string> is one or more characters. e.g., "abc123"

Character name examples:

    $ ugrep heart
    ☙	U+2619	REVERSED ROTATED FLORAL HEART BULLET
    ❣	U+2763	HEAVY HEART EXCLAMATION MARK ORNAMENT

    [ ... examples truncated for brevity ... ]
    😻	U+1F63B	SMILING CAT FACE WITH HEART-SHAPED EYES

    〉      U+3009  RIGHT ANGLE BRACKET (closing angle bracket)

    # Use -w to match only whole words.
    $ ugrep -w "R"			# Equivalent to "\\bR\\b"
    R	U+0052  LATIN CAPITAL LETTER R
    ℛ	U+211B  SCRIPT CAPITAL R (Script r)
    ℜ	U+211C  BLACK-LETTER CAPITAL R (Black-letter r)
    ℝ	U+211D  DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL R (Double-struck r)

    This is mostly useful for people who do not run a modern UNIX
    shell, like GNU Bash that expands braces on the command line. 

    It also fills in the gap until shells understand hexadecimal
    ranges. For example, the following is ignored by bash-4.4, but we

    Notes:

    * In Bash, if start or end begin with a "0", then it zfills to
      that width. For this program, the 0 is optional as it always
      uses the largest width of the two ends E.g., 23{0..ff} -> 2300, 2301,...
    * Does not handle nested braces nor alternation with a comma.
    * Should check for invalid ranges and ignore them instead of barfing.
    * Checks for and ignores prefix of U+ or 0x

    * Presumes both arguments are hexadecimal, this makes things weird where 
      {01..10} is expanded by Bash to ten numbers, but
      {01..0f} is expanded by this program to fifteen!

# Implementation notes:

# This is a rewrite of b9's AWK ugrep in Python. While AWK makes a lot
# more sense for what this program does (comparing fields based on
# regexps), a rewrite was necessary because GNU awk, while plenty
# powerful, uses \y for word edges instead of \b and that was bugging
# me. Gawk does this for backwards compatibility with historic AWK,
# which is all well and good, but gawk has no way to disable it for
# new scripts.
#
# Switching to Python did have the benefit of allowing more powerful
# Perl-like regexes (not that anyone has requested that).
# 
# One downside is that I needed a huge hairy regex to simply search
# only in a certain field of each line. Maybe there's some Pythonic
# way to do it, but it's not obvious. Perhaps a 2D array?
#
# Also, I took for granted that awk let me use ^ and $ to search for
# the beginning and ending of fields instead of lines. I tried to
# reimplement that in Python, but it's not quite right as it only
# checks the first and last character. For example, ugrep "^x" works,
# but ugrep "(^x)" does not.


# Note: I do not use Python's `unicodedata` module because it is
# insufficient. It allows one to search by character name only if the
# precise name: `unicodedata.lookup("ROTATED HEAVY BLACK HEART BULLET")`.
